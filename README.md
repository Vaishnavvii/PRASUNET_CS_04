This project implements a basic keylogger in Python that records and logs keystrokes made by a user on a computer system. Keyloggers can be used for educational purposes to understand how keystrokes are captured and logged.

Features:

1. Capture and log keystrokes in real-time.

2. Save logged keystrokes to a text file (keylog.txt).

3. Simple and lightweight implementation using the keyboard library.
